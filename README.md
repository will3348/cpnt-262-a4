### Code Journal
- I created a Html and set up a form , named action to "#".
- Created a dropdown with ```<selet>``` 
- In my js file, I ``` const ``` whole form with ``` document.querySelector("form");```
- Used
-  ``` 
 - const submitHandler = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault() 
 - ```    (don't know why fenced code block doesn't work here) to prevent refresh.
 - added ``` if (){}``` to set up the background color on the form.
 ### Problem
 At very begining, I was planning to code a language selection with radio button. After client selecting the language type, the paragraph in html will change languages. I finished everything, there was a logic error I assuming. I spend 2 hours to look up that, but I can't find it. I will ask a facilitator sometime this week.
